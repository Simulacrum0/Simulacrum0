- 👋 Hi, I’m @Simulacrum0
- 👀 I’m interested in developing wantware, a means for anyone to use natural language to create, tweak, edit or just understand software, enabling the 99% of the world who do not program to access the diverse and powerful compute capabilities of today, such as ML Recognition/Synthesis, Web Data, SDF graphics, physics-solvers, media-conversions, and world simulations
- 🌱 I’m currently working on NVIDIA PTX and AMD GCN submission via Linux Drivers/Libs for executable memory and passing instructions into VRAM. The goal is to enable a market for collaborating, trading, and monetizing digital behaviors and solutions for a more tech empowered world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building drivers for immediate mode GPU access for a pure-appliance computer ( instant boot, ring-0, single-instruction-feed execution space )
